#summary Info on Tele-Op(forgot to name the page and now it won't let me)

= Introduction =

This is all the info on what is available to everyone here for download and a couple of instructions

Ok...
So, at this moment in time, every subsystem is covered, Chassis, BallIntake, Shooter, and Arm.  There are commands for each subsystem...(some commands more useful than others).  If this code is uploaded to the CRIO, it will allow for pretty steady drivE(code which i stole from team 399), complete shooter capability(given all motors and sensors in the right ports), meaning it can be rotated, angle can be changed, and shooter wheel can be on or off...The arm(with a good relay ) will move down for .15 of a second and then back up...Balls should be able to be sensed, although actually there is not yet control over the conveyor belts...but that is easy--  I just don't know the ports that correspond to the  conveyor belt speed controllers.  Hopefully, there will be strides in the camera tomorrow, and we can start to crank out formulas for the shooter.  WORD, Good night


                                                                                                                             -*Carter*
P.S--I will be there tomorrow until 3, but just in case someone needs to refer to this...Come to this site, go to the source panel, and type the given command on your prompt to get a copy of the code, if you need it.
