Hello and welcome to our team's(3929) code written in Java for the FRC 2012 robotics competition.

> It took me FOREVER to figure out how to use this but I think I have a pretty good understanding of how Google Code works now.  I would like to have everyone on the programming team associated with this page.  I will invite everyone as I see them at Robotics.  To upload a file you can just go to downloads and then upload a new file.  However, if you wish to upload a slew of files, or just a whole folder, you will need to first zip the folder and then upload the file.  If you are on a mac, it should automatically do this for you.  However, on windows, you will need to right click the file, go to Send To, and then compressed zip folder.  Then, when you are uploading the folder just click that zip.  As we are the programming team, i'm sure you can figure that out on your own.  Ok, next thing is that you NEEEEEEEDDD to post any important information in the wiki.  If you find something out, whether everyone appears to know it or not, IT MUST GO ON THE WIKI.  That is all you need to know for now.  Visit the Updates tab to view recent downloads and such.  We will explore the many abilities of Google code as we progress.  Thanks guys.
