# Details #

The robot has many physical sub-systems and each sub-system contains many sensors. This will serve as a quick guide to the various sensors.

**Drive**

Current coder: Carter

_Sensors_

>Jaguars: These are the way a programmer can access the motors. They can control the motors speed.

>Encoder: This is a sensor which gives us a number of rotations. Using this we can find the distance the robot has driven and whether the motors are moving forward or backward.

**Arm**

Current coders: Bruce and Taylor

_Sensors_

>Spike: This is a relay which is a digital switch. You can control whether power can move through the spike or not(whether it is on or off.)

>Limit Switch: This is a sensor that detects if it pressed or not.

**Ball Intake**

Current coders: Leland and Janice

_Sensors_

>Victors: These are the way a programmer can access the motors. They can control the motors speed.

>Light Sensor: This Senses how dark or light it is. We are using it to sense the amount of balls in the intake.

**Shooter**

Current coders: Mr. Grey, Agata

>Encoder: This is a sensor which gives us a number of rotations. Using this we can find the distance the robot has driven and whether the motors are moving forward or backward.

>Pot: This detects angle.

>Camera: Images!
